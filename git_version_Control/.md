Version Control Systems & Git
Task: Learn Git for version control.
Practice:
Create a GitHub repository.
Clone the repo to your local machine, make some changes to your Node.js code, commit, and push changes back to GitHub.
Tool: GitHub, Git
Resources: GitHub tutorial on creating repositories and commits.

What is Git?
Git is a version control system that you download onto your computer.

What is GitHub?
GitHub is a product that allows you to host your Git projects on a remote server

How to get started using Git
 can either use Git by typing commands in the terminal or you can use a graphical user interface (GUI)
How does Git track changes?
create a new project folder (hint: we can use the mkdir command) and then navigate into that project folder in the
Once we are in our project folder, in order to start using Git we will need to create (or initialize) a repository using the git init command.

Once we execute the command by typing it in the terminal and pressing enter, it will probably seem like not much happened. But don’t be deceived, Git can be sneaky sometimes and it carries out a lot of actions behind the scenes.

In order to see what Git did behind the scenes we will have to view our hidden files. Make sure to open your project folder in your file system. Then, if you are on a mac you can select Command + Shift + Dot in order to see hidden files in your file system. If you are on a windows OS then you can change your view settings in order to view hidden files in your file system.

In order to view hidden files in the terminal we can use the command ls -a.

repository is the .git folder
we push (in other words upload) our local repository to one of these services, then the repository that resides in these service in the cloud is referred to as the remote repository.
It is important to use a remote repository in order to be able to collaborate with other people as well as to backup our projects

Collaborating with Other Developers Using Git

Developers clone the remote repository from the hosting service to their computer for a local repository.
Each developer has a local repository, and there's one remote repository for sharing work.
Understanding Git Commits

A commit is a version of your project with references to related files and folders.
Three Git spaces:
Working directory: Project folder where files are added, edited, or deleted.
Staging area: Rough draft space for updating or removing files for the next commit (.git/index).
Commit history: Where commits reside after being made (.git/objects).
How Git Tracks Changes

Git tracks changes through commits, which are versions of your project.

A typical Git workflow
Step 1: Edit Files
Create or edit files in your project.
For a new project, create the first file (e.g., touch chapter1.txt).
Use git status to check the state of the working directory and staging area.
Identify untracked files that need to be added to the staging area.
Step 2: Add Files to the Staging Area
Use git add to add new or updated files to the staging area.
Exclude files you don’t want to include in the next commit.
Use git status again to confirm files are in the staging area.
Note: Files are copied from the working directory to the staging area, not moved.
Step 3: Make the Commit
Use git commit -m "commit message" to make a commit with a message.
Example: git commit -m "this is the first commit".
Use git log to list all commits in reverse chronological order.
Each commit has a unique 40-character commit hash.
Commit details include the author, timestamp, and commit message.
Commit History in Git
A repository consists of multiple commits.
Each commit typically has one parent commit, forming a chain.
More complex histories involve branches and merges.
Branches in Git
A branch is a pointer to a commit.
The default branch is usually called master or main.
Branch information is stored in the .git/refs/heads directory.
Use git log to see all commits and their associated branches.

commands:  
git --version : check if you already have Git installed on your computer you can type the command
